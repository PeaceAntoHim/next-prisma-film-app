## How create next app with prisma and mongo
    1. First you have to write "npm i -D prisma" to install all prisma dependencies.
    2. Second you have install reguler dependencies for prisma client you have wrote this in cli "npm i @prisma/client"
    3. Third you have to initialize you project with write "npx prisma init"

## Step working with prisma, next and mongodb
    1. First you have to create schema table database in you schema.prisma and you have create mode your_example_table to create database.
    2. For mongodb you have to write this " id String @id @default(dbgenerated()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId" to generate id automaticly
    3. After made schema model you have to write this in cli "npx prisma dev --preview-feature" but this commnd just for relational database if you use mongo you have write "npx prisma generate" to generate data





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
